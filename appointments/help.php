 <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> 

<p>A very user friendly software package, for both staff and clients, for booking appointments online, for a single and multi-location business. Currently the ownership goes to Mr. Tom Reed for his own organization - 'Dappa Dogs'.

At Dappa Dogs, our priority is simple, the health and well being of your beloved dog – everything we do is designed with your dog’s safety in mind. Our staff are professionally trained to the highest of standards and of course they love dogs.

We opened our doors on the 7Jul 2008 in Orewa, Rodney. To cut a long story short, there are now 8 Dappa Dogs grooming salons, stretching from Orewa where it all started to Lower Hutt, Wellington!

Our Vision is also very simple: “To be regarded as the groomer of choice across New Zealand, for our clients who entrust their beloved dogs to our care!”

Dappa Dogs are members of the National Dog Grooming Association New Zealand and all our groomers train to a Master Groomer standard or equivalent. This is the highest accolade a groomer can be awarded and it is a 4 year process to complete.</p>
